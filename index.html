        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>I'm Arefeh Sherafati.</p>
        
        <p>I am a research scientist passionate about discoveries at the intersection of neuroscience and AI.</p>
    
        <p>Most recently, I completed my postdoctoral training at the University of California, San Francisco, where I led a project in collaboration with researchers at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. Together, we worked on open-sourcing the largest calcium imaging dataset to date from the mouse primary visual cortex.</p>
    
        <p>Before that, I earned a Ph.D. in physics and completed two years of postdoctoral research at Washington University in St. Louis. My work focused on developing computational methods for a novel neurotechnology modality called high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT).</p>
    
        <p>Prior to transitioning to the computational neuroscience research, I obtained an M.S. in gravitational physics.</p>

            <p>A systematic characterization of the neurons across an entire column in the primary visual cortex (V1) could provide insights into the depth-dependent physiological properties of this visual area. In order to explore these properties in mouse V1, we have recorded visual responses from pan-excitatory neurons within an 800 x 800 x ~800 µm3 region of the primary visual cortex (V1), spanning all layers from pia to white matter. This dataset includes 148,788 neurons in four awake mice (2 transgenic mouse lines), collected from two hundred and fifty 2-photon and seven 3-photon calcium imaging planes spaced by 25-16 µm. A wide variety of visual stimuli were used to characterize neural responses, including locally sparse noise, full-field and windowed drifting gratings, natural images, and a natural movie. We assessed multiple metrics, including receptive field profile characteristics, direction and orientation selectivity, stimuli decoding performance, response reliability, and sparseness of responses in this survey. We found depth-specific heterogeneities for many of the visual metrics that are consistent across visual columns and mice. These depth-specific heterogeneities exhibit varying patterns for different visual metrics including response reliabilities, stimulus decoding performances, and direction and orientation selectivity indices. The physiological dataset: the Allen Brain Observatory V1 Deep Dive (V1DD) is publicly available along with an open-source toolbox enabling the broader scientific community to further examine the single-cell and population activities across all visual layers in V1.</p>
